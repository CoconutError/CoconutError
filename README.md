# ðŸ‘‹  Hello, Iâ€™m Matteo.
#### I just mess around with code and sometimes it works.

```javascript
const matteo = {
  title: "software developer (maybe)",
  website: "Coming Soon! (i think)",
  code: [HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, LUA, C],
  technologies: [React, Tailwind, NextJS, AuthJS, Prisma]
}
```
